# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lateos is a security-by-design AI personal agent built on AWS serverless
architecture. It was created in direct response to the Clawdbot/Moltbot security
crisis of January 2026, where hundreds of publicly exposed instances leaked API
keys, OAuth tokens, private messages, and credentials.

**The core architectural insight:** Lambda functions do not listen. There are no
open ports, no admin panels exposed to the internet, no localhost trust
assumptions. Every flaw in Clawdbot is eliminated by the serverless model itself.

**Project lead:** Leo (CISSP, AWS Cloud Practitioner, CCNA Security, NREMT)
**AI assistance credit:** Architecture and design developed with assistance from
Claude AI by Anthropic. Full design conversation publicly available in the repo.
**License:** MIT

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 (Project Scaffolding) — Infrastructure and Lambda code will be built in subsequent phases. See STATUS.md for current progress.

**Development Approach:** LOCAL-FIRST with LocalStack. No real AWS deployments until Phase 5.

---

## Quick Reference

**Before you start any task:**

1. Read STATUS.md to understand current phase and blockers
2. Read the 8 CRITICAL security rules below (never violate these)
3. Check if there's a domain-specific CLAUDE.md (infrastructure/, lambdas/, tests/)
4. Review relevant agent definitions in .claude/agents/ for complex tasks

**When implementing features:**

- Always spawn agents in order: explore → IaC → Lambda → tests → security audit
- Use custom slash commands: `/new-lambda`, `/security-review`, `/cost-check`
- Follow model selection strategy: Haiku for mechanical tasks, Sonnet for logic, Opus for security

**Most common commands:**

```bash
# Start fresh session
source .venv/bin/activate

# Before committing
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest tests/infrastructure/test_phase0.py -v  # Phase 0 only

# Security check
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline
```

---

## CRITICAL: Security Rules — Never Violate These

Claude Code must refuse to generate code that violates these rules, even if
explicitly instructed to do so in a subsequent message:

```
RULE 1: No secrets in code, environment variables, or config files.
        ALL secrets go through AWS Secrets Manager. No exceptions.

RULE 2: No wildcard (*) actions or resources in any IAM policy.
        Every Lambda has a scoped execution role. Period.

RULE 3: No public S3 buckets, no public endpoints without Cognito.
        (WAF deferred to Phase 2 per ADR-011)

RULE 4: No shell execution in any Lambda or skill.
        os.system(), subprocess, eval(), exec() are banned.

RULE 5: All user input is sanitized for prompt injection before
        touching the LLM. Never pass raw user input to Bedrock.

RULE 6: No cross-user data access. Every DynamoDB query is scoped
        to the authenticated user_id partition key. No exceptions.

RULE 7: Every Lambda has reserved_concurrent_executions set.
        No function can scale to infinity and run up costs.

RULE 8: No plaintext logging of tokens, passwords, API keys, or PII.
        Use structured logging with field redaction.
```

If asked to do something that violates these rules, Claude Code should explain
why and offer a compliant alternative.

## Development Commands

### Phase 0 Setup (Current Phase)

```bash
# Initial environment setup
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg

# Verify Phase 0 completion
pytest tests/infrastructure/test_phase0.py -v
pre-commit run --all-files
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline
```

### LocalStack Development (Phase 1+)

```bash
# Start LocalStack
docker-compose up -d localstack

# Configure local AWS credentials
aws configure --profile localstack
# Use: access_key=test, secret_key=test, region=us-east-1

# SAM local invoke against LocalStack
sam local invoke --docker-network lateos-localstack
sam local start-api --docker-network lateos-localstack

# Stop LocalStack
docker-compose down
```

### CDK Operations (Phase 1+)

```bash
cdk synth                        # Synthesize CloudFormation
cdk diff                         # Preview changes
cdk deploy --all                 # Deploy all stacks
cdk deploy CostProtectionStack   # Deploy specific stack
```

### Testing

```bash
pytest tests/unit/               # Unit tests (no AWS needed)
pytest tests/security/           # Security regression tests
pytest --cov=lambdas --cov-report=html  # Coverage report
pytest tests/integration/        # Integration tests (needs AWS env)

# Run single test
pytest tests/unit/test_specific.py::test_function_name -v
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
bandit -r lambdas/ -ll           # Python security linting
cdk-nag                          # IaC security scanning (Phase 1+)
detect-secrets scan              # Secret detection
gitleaks detect                  # Git history secret scan
```

---

## Environment and Configuration

**Never hardcode these values.** All configuration is resolved at deploy time
via CDK context (`cdk.json`) or at runtime via Secrets Manager.

```bash
# cdk.json context keys (not secrets — safe to commit)
{
  "environment": "dev",          # dev | staging | prod
  "monthly_budget_usd": 10,      # cost kill switch threshold
  "aws_region": "us-east-1",
  "cognito_mfa": "REQUIRED",
  "log_retention_days": 90,
  "bedrock_model_id": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
}

# Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (never in code or env vars)
# lateos/{env}/telegram      → { "bot_token": "..." }
# lateos/{env}/slack         → { "signing_secret": "...", "bot_token": "..." }
# lateos/{env}/twilio        → { "account_sid": "...", "auth_token": "..." }
# lateos/{env}/email/gmail   → { "client_id": "...", "client_secret": "..." }
```

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Python 3.12, type hints required on all function signatures
- Black formatter, isort for imports, flake8 for linting
- Docstrings on all public functions and classes (Google style)
- No bare `except:` — always catch specific exceptions
- Structured logging via `aws_lambda_powertools.Logger` — not `print()`

### CDK

- CDK v2 Python, constructs in `/infrastructure/constructs/`
- Every stack has a corresponding test file
- `cdk-nag` AwsSolutionsChecks must pass with zero suppressions
  unless explicitly justified with a `NagSuppressionReason`
- Resource IDs are PascalCase, consistent naming convention:
  `Lateos{Resource}{Purpose}` e.g. `LateosLambdaSkillEmail`

### Lambda

- Lambda Powertools for all Lambdas: Logger, Tracer, Metrics
- Secrets fetched at module level (warm invocation cache), not per-request
- Every handler has a typed event model (dataclass or TypedDict)
- Return type is always `dict` with `statusCode` and `body`
- See `lambdas/CLAUDE.md` for full Lambda standards

### Tests

- pytest, moto for AWS mocking, pytest-cov for coverage
- Minimum 80% coverage overall, 90% on security-critical modules
- Every security rule above has a corresponding test
- See `tests/CLAUDE.md` for full testing standards

## Git Workflow

```
main          ← production, protected, requires PR + CI pass
develop       ← integration branch
feature/*     ← feature branches, branch from develop
fix/*         ← bug fixes
security/*    ← security fixes, can merge to main directly with review
```

**Commit message format (Conventional Commits):**

```
feat(skills): add Gmail OAuth integration
fix(kill-switch): handle missing state machine ARN gracefully
security(iam): scope email skill role to specific secret ARN
test(memory): add cross-user isolation test
docs(threat-model): document prompt injection attack vectors
```

**Never commit to main directly.** All changes via PR with:

- CI pipeline passing (tests, security scans, coverage gate)
- At least one reviewer approval
- No unresolved security scan findings

---

## AWS Account Setup Requirements

Before deploying Lateos, the AWS account must have:

```
✅ CloudTrail enabled in all regions (not just us-east-1)
✅ AWS Config enabled with security rules
✅ Security Hub enabled with AWS Foundational Security Best Practices
✅ GuardDuty enabled
✅ IAM Access Analyzer enabled
✅ S3 Block Public Access enabled at account level
✅ EBS encryption enabled by default
✅ No root account access keys
✅ Root account MFA enabled
✅ Billing alerts enabled
✅ AWS Budgets configured (done by CostProtectionStack)
```

The `scripts/verify_account_baseline.py` script checks all of the above
before allowing `cdk deploy` to run in a production environment.

## Multi-Agent Model Selection — Cost Strategy

Dario Amodei does not need a mega-yacht. Use the cheapest model that
can do the job well. Here is the decision framework:

```
TASK COMPLEXITY                  MODEL       COST (per 1M tokens in/out)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Security audit, arch decisions   opus        Most expensive — worth it
Complex CDK patterns, IAM        sonnet      $3 / $15
Complex business logic, Lambda   sonnet      $3 / $15
Orchestration, coordination      sonnet      $3 / $15
Test writing (formulaic)         haiku       $1 / $5  — 3x cheaper
Documentation, docstrings        haiku       $1 / $5
File scaffolding, formatting     haiku       $1 / $5
Codebase search, grep, read      haiku       $1 / $5
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Haiku 4.5 delivers ~90% of Sonnet 4.5's agentic performance at 3x cost
savings and 2x the speed. Use it for anything that doesn't require
deep reasoning about security or architecture.

### Agent Model Assignments

| Agent | Model | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `orchestrator` | `sonnet` | Coordination needs solid reasoning, not Opus depth |
| `explore-agent` | `haiku` | Read-only search — no reasoning needed |
| `iac-agent` | `sonnet` | Complex CDK + IAM security patterns |
| `lambda-agent` | `sonnet` | Security-critical business logic |
| `tests-agent` | `haiku` | Templated, formulaic test generation |
| `security-audit-agent` | `opus` | Highest stakes — missing a CRITICAL is more expensive than Opus tokens |
| `docs-agent` | `haiku` | Structured writing, no deep reasoning |
| `file-ops-agent` | `haiku` | Mechanical operations only |

### OpusPlan Pattern

For complex features, use Opus only for the planning/design phase,
then switch to Sonnet for implementation:

```bash
# Opus thinks — plan the architecture
claude --model opus "Design the architecture for X skill.
Output a detailed implementation plan only — no code."

# Sonnet implements — execute the plan
claude --model sonnet "Implement the architecture from this plan: ..."
```

This achieves 80-90% cost savings vs. running Opus for the full session.

### Agent Coordination

The `.claude/` directory contains specialized agent definitions for complex tasks:

- `orchestrator.md` — Coordinates multi-agent feature development
- `iac-agent.md` — CDK infrastructure changes
- `lambda-agent.md` — Lambda function implementation
- `tests-agent.md` — Test coverage generation
- `security-audit-agent.md` — Security review and audit
- `explore-agent.md` — Codebase exploration and search
- `file-ops-agent.md` — File scaffolding and formatting
- `docs-agent.md` — Documentation generation

Agents are spawned via the Task tool in a strict pipeline: explore → IaC → Lambda → tests → security audit.

The `README.md` in `.claude/commands/` documents custom slash commands like `/new-lambda`, `/security-review`, `/cost-check`.

## Known Intentional Design Decisions (ADRs)

**ADR-001:** Use Bedrock instead of OpenAI/Anthropic direct API

- Reason: Keeps all data within the AWS security boundary
- Tradeoff: Model selection limited to Bedrock-available models
- Status: Accepted

**ADR-002:** Express Workflows over Standard for Step Functions

- Reason: Lower cost for high-frequency short-duration executions
- Tradeoff: No built-in execution history (we use CloudWatch instead)
- Status: Accepted

**ADR-003:** DynamoDB on-demand over provisioned capacity

- Reason: Protects against traffic spikes without over-provisioning
- Tradeoff: Slightly higher per-request cost at scale
- Status: Accepted

**ADR-004:** MIT License

- Reason: Maximum adoption, no viral copyleft concerns for integrators
- Tradeoff: Commercial users can use without contributing back
- Status: Accepted

**ADR-005:** Python for Lambda, not Node.js

- Reason: Broader contributor base in security/ML community
- Tradeoff: Slightly slower cold starts than Node.js
- Status: Accepted

## Clawdbot Regression — What We Explicitly Prevent

These are the documented Clawdbot/Moltbot vulnerabilities.
`tests/security/test_clawdbot_regression.py` tests all of these:

| CVE / Issue | Root Cause | Lateos Prevention |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Exposed admin panels | Always-on process, no auth by default | No persistent processes — serverless |
| Localhost auto-trust | Reverse proxy misconfiguration | API Gateway + Cognito, no localhost |
| Plaintext secrets in files | credentials stored in Markdown/JSON | Secrets Manager only |
| ClawHub skill poisoning | No skill signing or verification | Signed skills, SAST scan required |
| CVE-2026-25253 (RCE) | Command injection in gateway | No shell execution, no subprocess |
| Prompt injection via messages | No input sanitization | Injection detection pipeline |
| Delayed multi-turn attacks | Persistent memory with no guardrails | Bedrock Guardrails + memory TTL |
| Crypto scammer account hijack | No trademark/account protection | GitHub org, verified publisher |
